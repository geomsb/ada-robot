The mission of Ada Developers Academy is to diversify tech by providing women and gender diverse people the skills, experience, and community support to become professional software developers to change the face of tech, Ada Developers Academy is a non-profit, tuition-free coding school for women and gender diverse adults.

The program combines classroom training and a paid learning internship to teach our students both how to write code (practical tools and computer science fundamentals) and how to be a software developer (leadership, inclusivity, and career). 

Our inclusivity is showed on students, staff, volunteers, TA’s, and reps from our sponsor companies come to Ada Developers Academy with an incredible diversity of identity and experience.

The Jump Start Live is for students who need extra support and it starts one month before the classes start and the Jump Start Curriculum must be completed by our students prior to their first day at Ada the content covers foundational concepts such as the basics of coding languages and getting comfortable with tools.

The classroom experience consists of 8 hours a day, 5 days a week for 24 weeks, the curriculum is divided up into one-week units, and each week features a project that reinforces that week’s learning objectives.

A capstone project is created by or students in order to show what they have learned.

The advocacy of the program includes workshops focused on justice, bias intervention, and inclusive community therefore our Adies are not only trained to be strong developers but also strong advocates.
