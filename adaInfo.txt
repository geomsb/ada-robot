Program
Our highly immersive, tuition-free program combines classroom training and a paid, learning internship to teach our students both how to write code (practical tools and computer science fundamentals) and how to be a software developer (leadership, inclusivity, and career). 
One of Ada’s most unique attributes is the fact that it is tuition-free.

Inclusivity
Students, staff, volunteers, TA’s, and reps from our sponsor companies come to Ada Developers Academy with an incredible diversity of identity and experience. 

Who was Ada Lovelace
Augusta Ada Lovelace, the 19th century mathematician who is considered the founder of computer science.

Jump Start
All students are asked to complete our Jump Start curriculum prior to their first day at Ada. The content covers foundational concepts such as the basics of coding languages and getting comfortable with tools.

Jump Start Live
Students who need extra support participate in Jump Start Live, an in-person classroom experience one month before the program starts.

Classroom experience
Students are in the Ada classroom 8 hours a day, 5 days a week for 24 weeks. The curriculum is divided up into one-week units, and each week features a project that reinforces that week’s learning objectives.

Capstone
As a culmination of each student’s classroom learning experience, they create a Capstone project to showcase what they have learned thus far in the program.

Advocacy
Adies are not only trained to be strong developers but also strong advocates. Students participate in a series of workshops focused on justice, bias intervention, and inclusive community.

Internships
During the latter part of the classroom portion, students will participate in an interview week where they will interview with six companies. Students will be placed with one of the companies for their internship.

Who can apply
You have permanent work authorization in the United States and you are able to participate for the full duration of the program, which is full-time, Monday through Friday.

Timeline
Cohorts start twice a year, in September and February. The application window opens approximately six months prior to the start of the cohort for about a three-week duration.

Aplication Process
The application process includes 4 parts: online application, code challenge, technical interview, and in-person/virtual interview. All phases after the application are by invitation only.

Financial support
For students who need assistance covering their living expenses during the Ada classroom portion, we offer a low-interest loan through our lending partner, Craft3.
